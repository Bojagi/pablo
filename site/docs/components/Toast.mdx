# Toasts

Toasts can be used to give feedback to an action the user just did. This can be a success message or an error
that happend. Toasts should be used as often as possible after actions that take some time (like API calls).
This can also be used as a notification if something happened without user interaction (like a new message
a user received from another user or something that happened some time ago but is now ready).

## Import

```js
// In your App.js or somewhere global
import { ToastProvider } from '@bojagi/pablo/ToastProvider';
// In places where you want to add toast messages
import { useToast } from '@bojagi/pablo/ToastProvider';
```

## Using ToastProvider

You need to wrap the `ToastProvider` within your app or section where you want to use toasts. In this provider
you can configure the side in where your toasts will appear.

## Add a new toast message

To show a toast with a specific message you need to use the `useToast` hook. It's returning an object
with an `addToast` function. This one can be used to push a new toast message.

The `addToast` function takes an object with the following properties:

* `duration` describes the time the toast is shown, if it's `0` it shows until closed manually
* `title` is the main text that is displayed in the toast
* `description` is an optional text that shows below the title
* `type` can be either `info`, `success`, `warning` or `error` 
* `closable` defining if a toast can be closed manually
* `icon` is an optional custom icon that is shown on the left side of the toast text, needs to be a `ReactNode`

```jsx live
() => {
  const { addToast } = useToast();
  const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(1);
  const [closable, setClosable] = React.useState(true);
  const [duration, setDuration] = React.useState(3000);
  const handleAddToast = React.useCallback(() => {
    addToast({
      duration,
      title: `Hello there #${counter}`,
      description: 'Something happened!',
      type: 'success',
      closable,
    });
    setCounter(counter + 1);
  }, [addToast, duration, closable, counter]);
  return (
    <ToastProvider>
      <Box>
        <Checkbox
          mb={4}
          label="closable"
          checked={closable}
          onChange={() => setClosable((val) => !val)}
        />
        <Input
          label="Duration (0 for forever)"
          mb={4}
          onChange={(v) => setDuration(parseInt(v, 10) || 0)}
          value={duration}
        />
        <Button onClick={handleAddToast}>Add toast</Button>
      </Box>
    </ToastProvider>
  );
}
```

# Customization

Pablo is highly customizable with the principle of making customizations as easy as possible and 
reduce boilerplate code. As Pablo is built on top of `styled-components` and `styled-system` it
utilizes both libraries to achive this.

## Ways of customization

There are different options for you to customize your components, all with different use cases
in mind. We tried to make global style changes as easy as possible without the need to wrap the
components on your own and end up with a mix of custom, wrapped and original components, which leads
to inconsistent design and code quality.

There are five different ways you can customize components:

* Overwrite single styling properties such as padding or margin with `styled-system` props
* Update the theme values to update primitives like color or typographic values globally
* Change the `componentStyles` config to update component specific values such as gaps, colors or sizes
* Overwrite styling of parts of components globally with styled-component's `css` tag literal
* Overwrite styling of parts of components in place with the `customStyles` prop

## Use styling props

The quickest way to overwrite certain styles are the styling props that `styled-system` provides.
Most of the components of Pablo support these props which mainly should be used for layouting purposes
like adding margins (the `mx` and `my` props are quite useful for this). But you can also use
them to change color on more plain components like `<Headline />`. 

Example:

<Playground>
  <Headline mb={9} textColor="brand.main">This is my colorful main headline</Headline>
  <Paragraph>Negative margins on outer boxes are a nice way to make up for inner margins</Paragraph>
  <Box display="flex" mx={-2}>
    <Avatar mx={2} src="https://bojagi.io/static/jm-a00804c651028a5a7aef34fc7718af46.jpg" />
    <Avatar mx={2} src="https://bojagi.io/static/sm-645d391052b195f495445a27f34c283e.jpg" />
    <Avatar mx={2} src="https://bojagi.io/static/sj-8caf8cfb656b71464fe1b15c9f6f44fd.jpg" />
  </Box>
</Playground>

## Customizing the theme

The theme is a set of design primitives that affect the look of all your UI across all components.
This includes color, spacing, typography (like font sizes, weight, line heights etc.) and breakpoints.

The theme needs to be passed in the `PabloThemeProvider` that has to be wrapped around your app:

```jsx
import { PabloThemeProvider } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';

const customTheme = { /* your custom theme */ };

const App = () => (
  <PabloThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    /* The rest of your app */
  </PabloThemeProvider>
)
```

Read more about it in the [Theme section](/theme).

## Customizing component styles 

Changing the theme itself most of the time is not enough as it touches more general styling. To
customize the look of your UI even more you can configure the different components separately using
`componentStyles`:

```jsx
import { PabloThemeProvider } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';

const customTheme = { /* your custom theme */ };
const customComponentStyles = { /* your custom component styles */ };

const App = () => (
  <PabloThemeProvider theme={customTheme} componentStyles={customComponentStyles}>
    /* The rest of your app */
  </PabloThemeProvider>
)
```

Like the theme the component styles are passed to the pablo theme provider and you can just overwrite
them partially as they are merged with the default styles.

You can use theme values by accessing them through CSS variables. For easier access Pablo provides a nested object 
that contains the CSS variables. For usage of those take a look at the example below.

Here is an example of some component configurations overwritten:

```js
import { getSpacing } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
import { theme } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';

const customComponentStyles = { 
  checkbox: {
    innerPadding: {
      medium: getSpacing(3),
      small: getSpacing(2),
    },
    handleColor: theme.colors.brand.light,
  },
  button: {
    base: {
      icon: {
        gap: '4px',
      },
      borderRadius: '2px',
      focus: {
        outlineSize: '8px'
      },
    },
    brand: {
      outlineColor: theme.colors.brand.darkest,
    },
    sizes: {
      small: {
        padding: css`
          8px 12px
        `,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In the future all component documentation have a full list of all component style configurations.
Please be patient until then or have a look in the source code or utilize the TypeScript types.

## Overwriting styles 

If even this is not enough for your custom styling needs you can overwrite the styling of
the different component parts completely with the `customStyles` property. To do this you use the 
`css` tag template literal. This should be done in the `componentStyles` through the
`PabloThemeProvider` as well, but you can do this on single elements as well (more about that in the next section).

Each component has a set of parts where you can overwrite styles. You can find an example below:

```js
import { getSpacing } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
import { theme } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

const customComponentStyles = { 
  button: {
    customStyles: {
      primary: css`
        transform: rotate(15deg);
        // You can use style helpers
        color: ${theme.colors.brand.main};
        // And you can also access the props of the respective component parts
        ${props => props.color === 'brand' && css`
          color: orange;
        `}
      `,
    }
  },
  checkbox: {
    customStyles: {
      // The outer box of the checkbox
      box: css`
        background-color: blue;
      `,
      // The selection handle of a checkbox
      handle: css`
        background-color: red;
      `,
      // The optional text label
      label: css`
        text-decoration: underline;
      `,
    },
  },
};
```

Because these custom styles are just injected into the component parts you can use the full
theme values, including the Pablo style helpers and the props of the element you are styling.

In the future all component documentation have a full list of all customly stylable parts.
Please be patient until then or have a look in the source code or utilize the TypeScript types.

## Inline custom styles

Sometimes you need to create your own custom variant of a component that is unique to only a specific
area of your app or site (e.g. a huge button for your masthead).

To achive this you can use the `customStyles` prop on any component and use the same object structure
you would use in the `componentStyles` object.

The below examples do the same customizations as the global styling example above.

<Playground>
  <>
    <Checkbox
      checked
      customStyles={{
        // The outer box of the checkbox
        box: css`
          background-color: blue;
        `,
        // The selection handle of a checkbox
        handle: css`
          background-color: red;
        `,
        // The optional text label
        label: css`
          text-decoration: underline;
        `,
      }}
      label="Pizza"
    />
    <Button
      mt={6}
      customStyles={{
        primary: css`
          transform: rotate(15deg);
          // You can use style helpers
          color: ${theme.colors.brand.main};
          // And you can also access the props of the respective component parts
          ${props => props.color === 'brand' && css`
            color: orange;
          `}
        `,
      }}
    >
      Click me
    </Button>
  </>
</Playground>

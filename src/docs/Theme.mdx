# Theme

The theme is a set of design primitives that affect the look of all your UI across all components.
This includes color, spacing, typography (like font sizes, weight, line heights etc.) and breakpoints.

The theme needs to be initialized with the `PabloThemeProvider`.

```jsx
import { PabloThemeProvider } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';

const customTheme = { /* your custom theme */ };

const App = () => (
  <PabloThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    /* The rest of your app */
  </PabloThemeProvider>
)
```

You can overwrite all or some of the theme values. They will be merged with the default ones to create a complete theme.

## Color

There are different types of colors you can use. The most important color being `brand`, which represents
your brand color. It is used to highlight interactable elements and sets the tone of your brand. Brand is a shaded color.

### Shaded colors
Shaded colors are `brand`, `positive`, `negative` and `neutral`.  They have a `main` variant which is used when
there is no specific shade specified and and different darker or lighter shades:

* `lightest`
* `light`
* `main`
* `dark`
* `darkest`
* `contrastText`
* `contrastTextLight`

In addition to the shades they all have contrast text for normal/dark and light backgrounds as well
to define a text color that guarantees contrast and readability on colored backgrounds (like buttons).

### Gray

There are three kinds of gray color palettes: `gray`, `blackOpacity` and `whiteOpacity`. They all have
the same shades:

`50`, `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`, `900`

By default these represent a percentage scale from black to white, where `50` is 5% black and `900` 90%.

The two opacity palettes use transparency instead of solid shades where the base color is either black or white.
This is useful when you want to use gray scales on top of colored backgrounds (e.g. `whiteOpacity` on dark backgrounds)
because of the transparency the gray shades adjust to the background color.

### Common colors

There are some common colors specified:

* `white` (default `#ffffff`)
* `black` (default `#000000`)
* `whiteContrastText`: (default `#000000`)
* `blackContrastText`: (default `#ffffff`)

### Other colors

You can also set text, border and background colors. For a full overview look at the default theme
displayed at the end of this document.

## Spacing

Spacing is used to define spaces between components (not used for spacing inside components like padding between button borders and text).

Currently it's an array of values, so when you want to access it you specify the index of the array:

```
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 64, 128]
```

Above you see the default spacings which grows in a fibunacci like scale, to get spacing of `8px`
you need to use index `4`.

Disclaimer:
This is subject to change in favor of multiplication of a base spacing as it is easier to remember
and is calculatable.

## Typography

Pablo uses the following typography elements which mostly reflect the `Typography` variants:

* `paragraph`
* `paragraphBold`
* `button`
* `headline`
* `title`
* `subtitle`
* `info`
* `infoBold`

Exception for this are the two `Bold` suffixed properties which are used for `<strong/>` emphasis text
within paragraph and info text respectively.

In addition to the above properties there is also a `base` config that are shared among all
`Typography` variants.

In `base` you can define the following options for all typography:

* `fontFamily`, which is used by all variants
* `fontWeight`, which is overwritten by some variants

The specific variants above have the following properties that overwrites the `base` when set:

* `fontSize`
* `lineHeight`
* `marginBottom`, which defines the margin at the end of the text block
* `fontFamily` (optional)
* `fontWeight` (optional)

## Breakpoints

Pablo uses five different breakpoints:

* default is mobile and up
* `sm` is used for portrait tablets
* `md` for landscape tables
* `lg` for small desktops like a laptop 
* `xl` for big screens

These breakpoints are specified as an array. To customize it you can use the `createBreakpoints` utility.

```js
import { createBreakpoints } from '@bojagi/pablo/theme';
// default mobile breakpoint is excluded, as it starts at 0
const breakpoints = createBreakpoints(['700px', '1000px', '1200px', '1920px']);
```

In addition to the array you an then also access the named sizes (like `lg`) though this as well

```js
const isTheSame = breakpoints[2] === breakpoints.lg;
console.log(isTheSame) // logs 'true'
```

## Using theme values in custom components

You can use the theme values in custom components that have been written with `styled-components`.

```js
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  background-color: ${props => props.theme.color.brand.main};
`;
```

As you can see this is quite long and a pain to write, therefore Pablo offers a set of helper functions.

### `getColor`

```js
import { getColor } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  background-color: ${getColor('brand')};
`;
```

The `getColor` function returns you the theme colors you specify in the arguments. It takes two
arguments, the first being the color and the second the variant. By default the second variant is `main`.

Below you find a full path example:

```js
import { getColor } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  background-color: ${getColor('positive', 'dark')};
`;
```

### `getSpacing`

With `getSpacing` you can get a spacing value of a specific index:

```js
import { getSpacing } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
const MyComponent = styled.div`
  margin: ${getSpacing(4)}; /* resolves to 8px on the default theme */
`;
```

### `breakpoints`

Use the `breakpoints` function to apply specific styles depending on the screen size.

```js
import { breakpoint, getSpacing } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
import { css } from 'styled-components';

const MyComponent = styled.div`
  /* Base styles (mobile and up) */
  padding: ${getSpacing(4)}; 

  /* Landscape tablet styles (and up) */
  ${breakpoint(
    'md',
    css`
      padding: ${getSpacing(6)};
    `,
  )}
`;
```

By default it applies the breakpoint styles the defined breakpoint and up. If you want to apply
it for styles below, you can pass the `mediaQueryBelow` function as third argument.

```js
import { breakpoint, getSpacing } from '@bojagi/pablo/styleHelpers';
import { mediaQueryBelow } from '@bojagi/pablo/breakpoints';
import { css } from 'styled-components';

const MyComponent = styled.div`
  /* Landscape tablet styles (and up) */  
  padding: ${getSpacing(6)}; 

  /* Base styles (mobile and up) */  
  ${breakpoint(
    'md',
    css`
      padding: ${getSpacing(4)};
    `,
    mediaQueryBelow,
  )}
`;
```

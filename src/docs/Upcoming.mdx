# Upcoming

The Pablo design system is just at the beginning. We used it internally on some projects already and
are dogfooding it, so we find out painpoints in how to customize it. You can see it in action on the
[Bojagi app](https://bojagi.io/demo) and [landingpage](https://bojagi.io).

## Missing components

There are still some really commonly used components missing:

* Select
* Table
* Breadcrumb
* Tags
* Autocompletion
* Badges
* Spinner
* Icon wrapping component (to help with injecting custom icons into components)

and more (have a look at [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Bojagi/pablo/issues/26) for that.

## Accessability

Currently Pablo is missing a lot of accessability features. The plan is to add them in the short term future.

## Long term plans

Right now Pablo is a single library and although customizable it has still some drawbacks:

* Adding new components is easy, but only from within the library itself, external additions of custom components to the design system do not feel integrated.
* There is a set over overwrites needed for complete customizability and these overwrites can break when the base style changes.

### Splitting Pablo into different libraries

Because of this we are planing to separate the design-system into three separate libraries:

#### Pablo System

Underlying library making it easy to create new components that utilize the theme and `componentStyle` configurations.
This library will also be used by all core Pablo components. 

#### Pablo Core

Plain and (almost) completely unstyled components. Pablo Core provides component specific logic and
a plain canvas in terms of styling. You don't need to create a `Select` element from scratch. Just add
styles without the need of resetting and overwriting existing base styling.

#### Picasso (aka more opinionated design library)

The outer styled layer on top of the core library. It's basically what Pablo is now but using
the other two library layers as the basis. 

### Why different libraries?

There always has been the pain of customizing existing design libraries, be it Bootstrap, Material UI or Ant design.
Style updates may break the view and you end up with a lot of overhead. 
The original styles are still shipped with your code, although overwitten.

We believe that you should focus on your designs and not on replicating common functionality like
buttons, input fields, checkboxes or select fields.

And if you like how Pablo looks now, you can use the opinonated library and just adjust it to your liking
(how it already works now).

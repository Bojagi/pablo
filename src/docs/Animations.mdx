# Animations

A good UX lives from good and reasonable animations. With animations users for example spot newly added
components easier. Animations can also improve the connection between two elements or a user action 
(e.g. a menu that slides in after clicking on a button).

But animations are also hard to create, especially enter and exit animations, as you need to keep your elements
available until the exit animation is finished. Existing tooling tries to make this kind of animations easier,
but it's still a lot of boilerplate code or you need to write your own abstractions 
(e.g. to make it work with `emotion`).

Pablo tries to abstract animations, so you don't need to worry about them too much, all you need to do is wrap
the component that you want to show/hide with an animation in an animation component 
(e.g. `SlideAnimation` or `FadeAnimation`).

Currently Pablo has three build in animations, `StackAnimation`, `SlideAnimation` and `FadeAnimation`. You
can easily [write your own animations](#custom-animations) as well.

Some animations like `StackAnimation` and `SlideAnimation` need additional props (like the `side` where the animation
should happen).

In the example below you can declare the animation duration and show and hide the wrapped component.
In the code you can change `AnimationComponent` to be either `SlideAnimation` or `FadeAnimation`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const AnimationComponent = SlideAnimation; // or use FadeAnimation
    const animationComponentProps = {
      side: 'left',
      reverse: false,
    };
    const [duration, setDuration] = React.useState(300);
    const [visible, setVisible] = React.useState(false);
    return (
      <Flex
        alignItems="stretch"
        height={400}
      >
        <Flex justifyContent="center" alignItems="center" flexGrow={1} flexBasis={0}>
          <Box mb={4}>
            <Checkbox
              mb={1}
              checked={visible}
              onChange={() => setVisible((v) => !v)}
              label="visible"
            />
            <Input
              label="Duration"
              mb={1}
              onChange={(v) => setDuration(parseInt(v, 10) || 0)}
              value={duration}
            />
          </Box>
        </Flex>
        <Box
          display="flex"
          justifyContent="center"
          alignItems="center"
          flexGrow={1}
          flexShrink={0}
          flexBasis={0}
          bgColor="gray.50"
        >
          <Box maxWidth={400} height={200}>
            <AnimationComponent duration={duration} visible={visible} {...animationComponentProps}>
              <Card>
                <Title>I am animated</Title>
              </Card>
            </AnimationComponent>
          </Box>
        </Box>
      </Flex>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Common animation props

All animation components share the following props

### `duration`
Duration of the animation in milliseconds.

### `visible`
Boolean value that defines if the wrapped component should be shown or not. If this value changes from `false` to `true`
the enter animation is played, if it changes from `true` to `false` the exit animation is played.

## Animation components

### `SlideAnimation`

The `SlideAnimation` is helpful for popups and toasts. It has the following props to affect the animation:

#### `side`
You can specify the `side` where the animation happens  (e.g. `top` means ot slides in from the top). 
Can be either `top`, `right`, `bottom` or `left`.

#### `reverse`

You can also revert the direction, which makes it slide in from the opposite site.
This is helpful for things like tooltips, where you want to share the `side` prop but want to slide to the other direction 
(e.g. slide away from the wrapped component instead of sliding to it).

```js
// reverse prop is false by default
<SlideAnimation duration={300} visible={true} side="top">
  <div>hi</div>
</SlideAnimation>

// With reverse being true
<SlideAnimation duration={300} visible={true} side="top" reverse>
  <div>ho</div>
</SlideAnimation>  
```

### `FadeAnimation`

The `FadeAnimation` is really simple, it fades the component in and out. It does not have any props in addition to the
common animation props.

```js
<FadeAnimation duration={300} visible={true}>
  <div>hi</div>
</FadeAnimation>
```

### `StackAnimation`

The `StackAnimation` is similar to the slide animation. Difference is that the animation side is fixed, entering from 
the bottom and leaving to the top. It also pushes the surrounding content during the animation. So during the enter
animation it pushes the content below down and pulls it back up when the exit animation is played.

The `StackAnimation` is used as the default animation for toasts.

```js
<StackAnimation duration={300} visible={true}>
  <div>hi</div>
</StackAnimation>
```

## Usage with bojagi components

Some bojagi components allow to replace the default animation. To do this you simply pass the animation component
as with the `animation` prop. If animation customization is possible, the component will also have an `animationProps`
prop for any custom animation prop.

Among others the following components allow animation replacement:

* [`Menu`](/menu)
* `Popover` (more internal component that is used by `Menu` and `Tooltip`)

This is an example with the `Menu` component:

```js
<Menu
  // ... all the other menu props
  animation={SlideAnimation}
  animationProps={{
    duration: 150,
    side: 'bottom',
  }}
>
  // ...the wrapped component
</Menu>
```

## Custom animations

It's really easy to write custom animations, here's the source code for our fade animation:

```js
import { css } from '@emotion/react';
import { createInOutAnimation } from '@bojagi/pablo/animation';

const fadeAnimationBase = css`
  transition: ${(props) => css`opacity ${props.duration}ms`};
  opacity: 0;
`;

const fadeAnimationEnter = css`
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0) translateX(0);
`;

const fadeAnimationExit = css`
  opacity: 0;
`;

export const FadeAnimation = createInOutAnimation({
  baseStyles: fadeAnimationBase,
  enterStyles: fadeAnimationEnter,
  exitStyles: fadeAnimationExit,
});
```

To create a custom animation, you need to use `createInOutAnimation`. This creates an animation component.
It takes three styles (just use styled-component's `css` tag literal) for different steps.

*  `baseStyles` for shared styles (hold pre init styles and default transitions)
* `enterStyles` for styles when the wrapped component should be visible
* `exitstyles` for styles when the wrapped component should be hidden

You can use custom props for animations by just accessing it like usual in emotion (like with the duration
prop in the example above).

Bojagi is still WIP and doesn't cover all planned components yet.
View the components on [Bojagi](https://bojagi.io/app/github/Bojagi/pablo/).

## What's the idea behind Pablo

Pablo is planned as a fully customizable design system with a low footprint. In it's current state the whole package is below 40kb gzipped.

## Components

Currently Pablo supports the following components:

* Avatar
* Box
* Button
* ButtonBar
* Card
* Checkbox
* IconButton
* Image
* Input
* Link
* Menu
* Modal
* Radio
* SidebarNav
* Switch
* Tabs
* TextArea
* Toasts
* Toolbar
* Tooltip
* Typography

And following utility components

* animations (collections of different animations)
* ClickOutside
* Popover
* PopoverArrow
* Portal

## Roadmap

For the future it is planned to split Pablo into three packages:

* System library to create new components for the Pablo ecosystem easily
* Completely unstyled base library with no styles - only functionality, so you have full freedom on the styling
* Style package with opinionated design
